            feeling pretty alright
            <br>
            <br>
            having a lot of fun thinking about story shit and silly jokes and bits
            <br>
            <br>
            im worried that i wont be able to keep working on panels. i guess i could just take breaks if i feel burnt out
            <br>
            the only reason it took so long to update this time is bc i didnt know what to do next and i had already spent myself on it. keep in mind this is literally something ive never done before
            <br>
            <br>
            im so glad its being recieved so well, it makes me feel really happy to see people take interest and suggest commands
